# Currency Exchange Portal

## Background of the Idea

There is a community of alumni from an Ecuadorian school spread across different countries around the globe, with the majority located in Europe. This community communicates primarily through WhatsApp, where they discuss various topics. One of the most common interactions involves buying and selling Euros in exchange for USD.

This is due to Ecuador's official currency being the USD. Alumni traveling to Europe or returning to Ecuador frequently need to exchange currencies. However, sending money from Ecuador to Europe is expensive due to high tax rates on outgoing USD transactions.

Currently, members post their currency exchange offers on WhatsApp. While this serves as a means of communication, it presents several shortcomings:

1. **Spamming Other Members:** Currency exchange offers often flood the chat, overwhelming members who are not interested.
2. **No Exchange Rate Reference:** Members lack a clear or reliable reference for exchange rates.
3. **Lack of Interaction Visibility:** There is no organized way to track, manage, or follow up on offers posted in the chat.
4. **Inefficient Matching:** Finding suitable exchange partners requires scrolling through numerous messages, making the process cumbersome.

## Purpose of the Portal

The Currency Exchange Portal aims to solve these issues by providing a dedicated platform for managing currency exchange offers. It will:

- Allow users to **create and manage offers** to buy or sell Euros and USD.
- Provide a **centralized, spam-free space** for the community to post offers.
- Fetch **real-time exchange rates** from external APIs for transparency and guidance.
- Enable users to **browse and filter offers** efficiently, ensuring seamless interactions between buyers and sellers.
- Maintain a simple, elegant, and user-friendly interface that aligns with the communityâ€™s needs.

## Value Proposition

This portal will simplify and streamline the currency exchange process for the alumni community, saving time, reducing spam, and facilitating smoother transactions. It offers a structured and transparent alternative to the informal WhatsApp-based system currently in use.
